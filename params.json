{"name":"Bootswatch","tagline":"Themes for Bootstrap","body":"Branch with vauxoo bootswatch theme.\r\n===\r\n\r\n\r\nBootswatch\r\n==========\r\n\r\nBootswatch is a collection of free themes for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nDownload the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet.\r\n\r\nThe themes are also hosted on [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).\r\n\r\nRails users should check out [twitter-bootswatch-rails](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to create your own theme\r\n----\r\nTo modify a theme or create your own, follow the steps below in your terminal. You'll need to have Git and Node installed.\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch.git`\r\n \r\nThen `cd` to bootswatch directory and run: \r\n\r\n`npm install`\r\n\r\nEdit `variables.less` and `bootswatch.less` in one of the theme directories, or create your own in /custom.\r\nIf you want to create your own theme just copy a desired base theme ie. If you want to modify Yeti theme do `cp yeti your_own_theme_name`\r\n\r\nThen edit the `index.html` of the root directory and add the path of your `your_own_theme_name` tho the list.\r\n\r\nInstall grunt `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomization\r\n------\r\n\r\nAfter modifying the files as you want type `grunt swatch:your_own_theme_name` to build the CSS for a theme, e.g., grunt swatch:amelia for Amelia. Or type grunt swatch to build them all at once. To have grunt available in the command line, install grunt-cli as described on the Grunt Getting Started page.\r\n\r\nBootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.\r\n\r\nEach theme consists of two LESS files. `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize [these settings](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables). `bootswatch.less` introduces more extensive structural changes.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Help page](http://bootswatch.com/help/) for more details on building your own theme.\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch. Send your request to `http://api.bootswatch.com/3/`.\r\n\r\nThe swatch objects are returned in an array called `themes`, each one with the following properties:  `name`, `description`, `preview`, `thumbnail`, `css`, `cssMin`, `less`, and `lessVariables`.\r\n\r\nMore info at http://bootswatch.com/help/#api\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\nThomas Park\r\n\r\n+ http://github.com/thomaspark\r\n+ http://thomaspark.me\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n------\r\n[Mark Otto](http://github.com/markdotto) and [Jacob Thornton](http://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).\r\n\r\n[Jenil Gogari](http://www.jgog.in/) for his contributions to the Flatly theme.\r\n\r\n[James Taylor](http://github.com/jostylr) for [cors-lite](https://github.com/jostylr/cors-lite).\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n----\r\nCopyright 2014 Thomas Park\r\n\r\nCode released under the MIT License.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
